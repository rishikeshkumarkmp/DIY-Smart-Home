Project Title
Arduino‑based Smart Home Automation System

🚀 Description
This project uses an Arduino Uno to integrate smoke, flame, light (LDR), rain sensors, an LCD display, and a buzzer to monitor environmental conditions. Alerts are triggered via the buzzer and real‑time statuses are displayed on the screen.

🧪 Features
Smoke Detector: Alerts on smoke presence

Flame Sensor: Detects open flame

LDR (Light Sensor): Measures ambient light

Rain Sensor: Monitors precipitation

LCD Display: Shows real‑time readings and statuses

Buzzer Alarm: Triggers audible alerts when thresholds are crossed

⚙️ Built With
Arduino Uno

MQ‑2 Smoke Sensor

Flame Sensor Module

LDR Sensor (Photoresistor)

Rain Sensor Module

16×2 LCD (I2C or parallel)

Passive Buzzer

Jumper wires & breadboard

Install dependencies:

Arduino IDE or PlatformIO

Open the SmartHome.ino sketch in your IDE and upload it to the Arduino Uno.

🔧 Wiring Diagram
Provide a clear diagram or table mapping each sensor and device to Arduino pins:

Arduino Pin	Sensor / Device
A0	MQ‑2 Smoke Sensor
A1	Flame Sensor
A2	LDR Sensor
A3	Rain Sensor
Digital D2	Buzzer
I2C SDA/SCL or D4‑D7 + EN + RS	LCD

(Add photo or Fritzing diagram here)

🚦 Usage
Power the system (via USB or 5 V adapter).

The LCD displays live sensor values and statuses: “Smoke: Safe”, “Rain: Detected”, etc.

If a sensor reading crosses a predefined threshold, the buzzer triggers an alert.

Use serial output for raw sensor values and debugging.

⚙️ Calibration & Thresholds
Explain thresholds and calibration techniques, e.g.:

MQ‑2 smoke level > 300 → "Smoke Detected"

Flame sensor digital output HIGH → flame detected

LDR reading < 200 → "Dark", etc.
